### Warnings & Errors

Since the project is separately deployed, the backend is deployed on Render and frontend on Vercel.

When there is no traffic for a while, the backend goes to sleep and takes some time when traffic comes again.

The backend takes 2-3 mins to wake up. During this time, the project is configured to show a warning message.

Once backend is online, everything is properly working.
